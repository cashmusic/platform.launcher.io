Paid digital downloads with your own S3 and Paypal accounts. A simple and efficient way to sell music
directly from your site.

You'll need:  

 - An S3 connection to upload files 
 - A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached 
 - To configure the asset for sale as an "item"
 - A valid Paypal connection

Start with your asset. Go to it's details page and look at the bottom of the left-hand column. You'll 
see an option to define commerce settings. Do that if you haven't already. Here you can give it a 
public title and description, set the price, and even enable "pay-at-least" pricing where a customer can
set his or own price, as long as it meets or exceeds your base price. 

And if you're using a release asset be sure you've added any files you want included in the downlaod as 
"fulfillment files" â€” the customer will be able to download all of these. 

Now go to elements and create a "Digital Purchase" element. Give it a name for your own reference. Now 
select the item and Paypal connection you'd like to use. Tweak messages until your heart's content.

Once the element is created, embed it and you're done. 

When a customer buys your music they'll go off-site to Paypal for the transaction and return to a 
confirmation page with download options. They will also receive a one-time use code to unlock the 
download just in case they're on mobile. (So **please check your email settings on the System Settings
page.**)

All completed orders will show up in the Commerce section under Orders.
