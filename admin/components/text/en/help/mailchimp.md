To start working with a MailChimp list all you need is your MailChimp **API key** and 
a **list ID**. Once you have connected the list it will stay synced with your local list 
and vice versa. 

*(Please note: this will not automatically import your list members prior to the 
connection being made. You'll need to export those manually first.)*

### Step by step  

 1. Obtain your **Mailchimp API key** by logging in and selecting "API Keys & Authorized Apps" 
    from the account menu. You can add or copy a key from here.
 2. Get the **list ID** by clicking "Lists" from the main MailChimp menu, then hovering over 
    the "Settings" link for the list you'd like to sync. Select "List settings and Unique ID" 
    then scroll to the very bottom of the page of options where you'll see the ID.
 3. In the CASH Music admin go to the System settings menu and choose "Connections" from the 
    main navigation. Add a new MailChimp connection and use the key/ID from your MailChimp account.
 4. Still in the CASH admin, go to People, then Lists. If you have already created a list 
    edit it, if not create a new one. You'll see the "connect to" option â€” your new MailChimp
    connection should show up. Select it, save, and you're done. Any new additions to your local
    list will be added to MailChimp.
