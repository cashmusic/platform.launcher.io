An **[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/)** connection is used to store and access files for assets. It 
offers a high level of security and reliability, while off-loading bandwidth that could swamp a smaller 
web host accounts.

### Step by step

To set up a connection to S3 you first need to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account at 
[aws.amazon.com](http://aws.amazon.com/). After that you're just a few quick steps away from setting 
everything up. 

 1. Log in and select "Security Credentials" from the left-hand menu. Copy the Access Key ID and the 
    Secret Access Key.
 2. Now you need to set up a "bucket" which is like an online folder for file storage. Go to the 
    My Account / Console menu at the top of the page, select AWS Management Console.
 3. Select "S3" from the available options. This will open the S3 management console.
 4. In the upper-left corner you'll see a "Create Bucket" button. Create a bucket, give it a name
    with all lower-case letters and no spaces. Copy this exactly. 
 5. Now in the CASH Admin open System Settings > Connections and add a new S3 connection. Give it a
    name, add the key, secret, and bucket you copied from Amazon, and the connection will be available 
    in the platform. 

All done.
