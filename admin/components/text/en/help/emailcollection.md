You can collect email addresses with or without offering downloads. It's totally up to you. Either 
way, email is very effective and lets you speak directly to the people who care most. 

You'll need:  

 - An S3 connection to upload files (for downloads)
 - A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached (for downloads)
 - A list created in the People section

With your asset and list in hand, head to the Elements section and create a new "Email Collection" 
element. Give the element a name for your own internal reference. Select the asset you'd like to 
offer for download (or none if you're not offering one.) Select the list you'd like people to sign
up to. And lastly, edit the default messages. (They assume you're offering a download...so be sure
to change them if you're not.)

Note the "Finalize/download without email verification (instant)" checkbox. If left unchecked then 
anyone signing up will be emailed to confirm the address is legitimate. **Be sure to check your email 
settings in the System Settings menu!** If you check the box you are essentially trusting that any 
emails given are legitimate. You'll get more sign-ups, but with less guarantee that they're legit.

Once the element is created, embed it and you're done.
