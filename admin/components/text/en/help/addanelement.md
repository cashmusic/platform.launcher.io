Until our JavaScript/iFrame embeds are ready you'll need PHP to embed an element on a page. We've 
included a **very** minimalist boilerplate you can use to get started or play around. To use it, 
simply open up the directory where you first uploaded the installer. Next to the "admin" and "public" 
folders you'll see a "boilerplate" folder. Open the index.php file in there to start.

Basically you just need two lines of code: the CASH initialization script for the top of the page 
and the element embed code for the element you want to include. 

To get the CASH initialization script for your install, go hover over your email address under the 
main menu and select System Settings. At the bottom of the page you'll see a line of code â€” that's 
the initialization code you need at the top of your page. It should go above all other content. 

Next go to the details page for the element you'd like to embed. Find it's PHP embed code, copy it,
and paste it into your page. That's it. 

You can embed as many elements on a single page as you'd like, but you only need to include the 
initialization script once.
