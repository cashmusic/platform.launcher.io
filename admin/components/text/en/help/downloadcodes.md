Every file or release asset can be associated with download codes. So first you'll need to add an S3
connection and upload some files â€” either direct as files or to a release under it's "fulfillment files" 
section. 

You'll need:  

 - An S3 connection to upload files
 - A file or release asset with fulfillment files attached

Once you have an asset you want to add codes to just go to it's edit screen. At the bottom of the 
left-hand column you'll see an option to generate or export codes. First add codes, then open it again 
to export an Excel/Google Docs compatible CSV file. 

Now go to Elements and add a new "Download Codes" element. Give it a name for your own internal reference. 
It'll work with any code you've generated, and automatically give the correct asset to any valid codes.
